# :globe_with_meridians: OcculusThemidis - LIVE :globe_with_meridians:
##### Live OcculusThemidis one page app, as produced by running `npm run build` from the master branch.
It is reachable at [`https://mzhukov1973.github.io/OculusThemidis`](https://mzhukov1973.github.io/OculusThemidis).

In order for client-side routing to work correctly when hosted at GitHub pages, two modifications has been made to the source:
- a `404.html` file has been added to /public folder,
- a redirection `<script>...</script>` has been been added to /public/index.html.
