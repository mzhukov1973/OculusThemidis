###### Version: 0.0.4

[React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based One-Page-App for one small but spunky law firm.

## ToDo: :calendar:
- [ ] Change current navigation bar to something more aesthetically palatable for both mobile and desktop/pad cases
- [ ] Check web app features work as intended:
   - [ ] Splash screen works with phones
   - [ ] Launch icons are chosen correctly for devices' screen dpi
   - [ ] App name is derived correctly from manifest.json
   - [ ] Apps' chosen display mode (standalone) is honoured by the device
   - [ ] Service worker works as intended (at least for reading the data from the server)
